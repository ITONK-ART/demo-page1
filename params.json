{"name":"Demo-page1","tagline":"Halaman Demo Page blog ITONK-ART","body":"### Welcome to ITONK-ART Demo Pages.\r\nGitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @kneath — love your sweater!\r\n\r\nBut I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:\r\n\r\n- [x] This is a complete item\r\n- [ ] This is an incomplete item\r\n\r\nAnd, of course emoji! :sparkles: :camel: :boom:\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\n- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported\r\n- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)\r\n- [x] this is a complete item\r\n- [ ] this is an incomplete item\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
